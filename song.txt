Sun is shining
Weather is sweet
Make you want to move
Your dancing feet, now
When the morning
Gather the rainbows, yeah
Want you to know I'm a rainbow too (I'm a rainbow too)

To the rescue
Here I am
Want you to know just if you can
Where I stand
Sun is shining
Weather is sweet, yeah
Make you want to move
Your dancing feet, now
When the morning
Gather the rainbows, yeah
Want you to know I'm a rainbow too (I'm a rainbow too)
To the rescue
Here I am
Want you to know just if you can
Where I stand
Oh, no, no
Oh, no, no
Sun is shining
Weather is sweet, yeah
Make you want to move
Your dancing feet, now
When the morning
Gather the rainbows, yeah
Want you to know I'm a rainbow too (I'm a rainbow too)
To the rescue
Here I am
Want you to know just if you can
Where I stand
Sun is shining
Sun is shining
